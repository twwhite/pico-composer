# Travel - Michigan Trip - Summer 2020

From late June into early July, Susie and I packed the car and headed to Michigan's Upper Peninsula for a remote outdoors trip.

With [COVID-19 still widespread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019), we abandoned our earlier plans for a 2020 Patagonia vacation. Our new goal was to find something that limited human contact; so what better than a backpacking and back-country camping trip?

We hiked, biked, kayaked, swam, ate, drank, off-roaded, and barely-slept. It was a hell of a trip!

## Road Trip Overview

It took two days of driving up and two days of driving back, stopping in Chicago overnight both ways. We touched into nine states and a ton of major cities for socially-distanced beer, meals, and some light city-viewing along the way. Here's an overview map of our route, with details below.

<!-- Here's the even more detail-filled recap for all of you crazy people still reading!
Day 1

We left Raleigh around 6:30am or so for what we anticipated to be a very long driving day.

After about five hours of carving through the Appalachian mountains, passing by small towns and coal mines, we made it to Charleston, WV.

Over the span of about thirty minutes, we walked around the downtown area, has a cold beer at one of the only open breweries in town, got a parking ticket, and were on our way. Side note: Throughout the trip we wore masks everywhere we stopped, practiced social distancing, and sanitized/washed constantly. Bad Shepherd Beer Company was the brewery, and we would definitely recommend their beer!

Road Trip Overview

Next major stop: Cincinnati.
Day 2

After 14+ hours on Day 1, we woke up to an excellent homemade breakfast picnic in great company on the river. Our next destination: a first-come-first-serve campsite near Brevort, MI with pit stops in Milwaukee and Green Bay. We estimated this leg of the trip would take about 7 hours, so we left around 9am.

Water Street in downtown Milwaukee was an unexpected breath of fresh air. The weather was pretty hot, and the sky was lake-cloudy. The orange-brick buildings contrasted perfectly against the blue colored sky peaking through the clouds. We managed to stop in for fresh Wisconsin Cheese Curds at a market in Milwaukee, spent some time walking around Water Street, touched our toes into the first great lake of the trip, Lake Michigan, stopped for Custard at a local shop in Green Bay.
